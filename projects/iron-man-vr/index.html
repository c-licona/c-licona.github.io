<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XIcDAdK5bM">Marvel&rsquo;s Iron Man VR | Meta Quest 2</a></p>
<p>In 2022 I graduated from DigiPen and got hired right out the gate by Endeavor One. We worked with <a href="https://www.camouflaj.com/home/">Camouflaj</a> as they were porting Iron Man VR to the Meta Quest 2.</p>
<p>This was a perfect opportunity for a recent grad like me because it allowed me to sort of bootstrap into the industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>I learned to work with my new coworkers (as well as those at Camouflaj)</li>
<li>I got eased into learning Unity which I only had limited experience with at the time</li>
<li>I got to explore the codebase through bug finding and fixing</li>
<li>I learned a lot about optimization since we were targeting mobile VR hardware</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-profiling">Performance profiling</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that I had just joined and was still learning the ropes, I was able to quickly provide value by running through the game with the performance profiler and identifying multiple areas that needed attention from the team. I made JIRA tickets where I provided profiling data such as the particular function calls that were causing performance spikes, or at the very least the very particular set of circumstances that were causing performance issues.</p>
<p>If there was someone available with the proper expertise to look into the issue then I could pass off this information to them. Otherwise, I was also able to go into the scenes and codebase myself to find a fix for the issue.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixing-and-improvements">Bug fixing and improvements</h2>
<p>I worked closely with our external partners who were providing QA services. They dug up bugs and logged them to JIRA, and I was able to pick up some of those bugs and look into fixing and verifying them. I also logged my fair share of bugs as well to either pick them up later or pass them off to others on the team. I played a LOT of Iron Man VR. You know how family members often ask &ldquo;so you play video games all day for your job?&rdquo; Well in this case, yes, yes I did.</p>
