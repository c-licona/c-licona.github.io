    <h1 id="3d-animation">3d Animation</h1>
<p>In an alternate universe I became a 3D animator instead of a Programmer. These are the origins of alternate universe me. In high school I took 3 years of 3D animation, by far my favorite class at the time. These are my final projects for my second and third year.</p>

<p>Halo Reach is a fantastic game. I would always make sure to do all my homework solely so my parents couldn&rsquo;t complain about all the video games I wanted to play. My high school days were filled with my friends and I playing the Halo games together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder I decided for my 2nd year project to recreate this scene from the Halo Reach campaign. The models don&rsquo;t hold up, but I am fairly proud of getting the timing right.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbngL6nqq2E">City Invasion - 3d Animation</a></p>
<p>A culmination of all that I learned about 3D modeling and animation in high school. A lot of time was spent building the floating city. More time yet making the splines that my vehicles would animate along. In the end I was really proud of the final product. I even won a trophy for having one of the top animation projects in the class!</p>

<p>In 2012 Valve released Source Filmmaker, their in-house tool for creating the cinematics for their games. Naturally I jumped in and started putting my 3D animation skills to the test.

<p>My friend and I would play a lot of Team Fortress 2. I found this combination of gear for the Engineer that I loved to play with. It involved my trusty Frontier Justice and my quick deployable level 1 turret that my friend and I would affectionately call &ldquo;Dinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then there was this idea. What if I created a mini-series about the Engineer, his Frontier Justice, and Dinky the Sentry. It never ended up going anywhere, but this was a test shot of what I was imagining.</p>

<h4 id="facial-animations">Facial Animations</h4>
<p>One very cool feature of SFM is the ability to completely animate the faces of the TF2 characters using phonemes. Basically, if you want the character to have a wide dumb grinning face, you would take the EEE phoneme slider and drag it to its max value. Because when you say EEE, you smile. At least that&rsquo;s how I remember it working.</p>
<p>I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could animate characters and their facial expressions. So I took this one scene from Batman Begins to recreate in SFM. The scene where Ra&rsquo;s al Ghul meets Bruce Wayne for the first time. Why this scene in particular? I don&rsquo;t know I just really like the Nolan Batman movies.</p>
<p>I never ended up recreating the entire scene, but I felt pretty good with what I had accomplished.</p>
