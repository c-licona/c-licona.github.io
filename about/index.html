<div class="content-container-2" >
    
<div class="content-container">
    <p>I am a <strong>Tools and Gameplay Engineer</strong>. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.digipen.edu">DigiPen Institute of Technology</a> in 2022 where I studied and earned my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the degree program: <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2022, I joined the <a href="https://www.endeavorone.com">Endeavor One</a> team and helped ship <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/marvels-iron-man-vr/5017327094985781/">Iron Man VR</a> for the Meta Quest 2. During my time at Endeavor One I have helped explore the frontier of VR/MR games. I have worn many hats as one of the few engineers on the team, prototyping game mechanics, building tools to streamline our build process, working with designers and providing them with tools to explore new ideas, and working with animators and artists to integrate their work.</p>

<p>I love seeing and helping others succeed. As a tools engineer I get to build and design tools that can enhance the development experience of my peers. To me there is nothing more rewarding then seeing my friends and peers achieve their dreams utilizing something that I helped build for them. As a game engineer I get to bring ideas to life, inspired by the talented developers before me who have made the hundreds of games I&rsquo;ve played since I was a kid.</p>
<p>I am proficient in C, C++, and C#. I have experience in Lua, Python, and GLSL/HLSL. I have worked with commercial engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4, and I have built and used custom engines in C/C++. I have studied and gained experience in topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Structures</li>
<li>Algorithm Analysis</li>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Memory Management</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Parallel Programming</li>
<li>Linux Environments</li>
<li>Computer Graphics</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Data Science</li>
<li>Raytracing</li>
</ul>
